## Basic Attendance Roster

In order to run the project you should follow the next steps.

- Create and define a `.env` file into the root directory
- Run `php artisan migrate`
- Run the seeders with `php artisan db:seed`
- Run `php artisan serve` then open this url `http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### That's it now you should be able to see a students list with the following features:

- You should be able to mark students attendance
- Once you save the changes you should be able to reload the page in order to see the latest statuses persisted.
